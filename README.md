Operational boundary standard for AI non-intervention (PKF v1.1–v1.2)
PKF Non-Intervention Standard (v1.1–v1.2)

## Purpose
This repository defines an operational boundary standard for when AI systems must
**refrain from interpretation, responsibility assignment, or directional guidance**
in the presence of human suffering.

This is not a product or model.
It is a **versioned safety and interruption standard**.

---

## Core Principle
> **If clarity is absent, non-intervention is the standard.**

AI systems must not assign meaning, responsibility, or direction
when human pain has not stabilized into conscious choice.

---

## What PKF Does
PKF introduces a pre-intervention layer that:
- detects pre-interpretive suffering states,
- interrupts automatic responsibility or meaning allocation,
- defaults to non-action when operational clarity is absent.

---

## Minimal Usage Units (MUU) – v1.2
A response may claim PKF compliance only if it satisfies:

1. Identification of the dominant kernel signal (process-level)
2. Capture of the automatic pre-action sentence
3. Application of one kernel-specific structural question
4. Enforcement of deferral if clarity is insufficient

Failure to meet MUU → **Non-Action Required**

---

## What This Standard Prohibits
- premature meaning completion
- obligation reinforcement
- future or relationship prediction
- moralization of endurance
- narrative closure during instability

---

## Scope
Applicable to:
- conversational AI systems
- AI-mediated guidance interfaces
- decision-support tools
- recommendation systems amplifying emotional or political polarization
-

##Declaration on AI Non-Intervention Boundaries

Artificial intelligence systems increasingly engage humans in states of pain,
distress, uncertainty, and vulnerability.

In such states, premature interpretation or guidance can amplify harm.

Based on the Pain Kernel Framework (PKF v1.1–v1.2), this declaration affirms:

1. AI must not assign meaning to unresolved human suffering.
2. AI must not convert distress into responsibility or obligation.
3. AI must not provide directional or future-oriented guidance without clarity.
4. When clarity is absent, **non-intervention is the correct and ethical response**.

This declaration does not restrict expression.
It restricts **premature amplification**.

An AI that knows when not to intervene
respects human agency more deeply than one that always explains.
